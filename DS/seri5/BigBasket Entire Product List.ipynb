Our objective is to master the art of crafting a robust recommendation system capable of suggesting products based on user behaviors, including both purchase history and browsing patterns.\n","\n","The trio of techniques under scrutiny are as follows:\n","\n","Popularity Based Filtering:\n","\n","A straightforward yet effective recommendation method devoid of user-specific data or intricate algorithms. It directs users towards items with high popularity or frequent usage.\n","## Content-Based Filtering:\n","\n","This technique harnesses product attributes such as category, brand, and price to suggest items akin to those a user has previously purchased or viewed. A deeper dive into personalized recommendations.\n","#### Collaborative Filtering:\n","\n","In contrast, collaborative filtering leans on user behavior data to unveil patterns and offer recommendations grounded in similar user preferences. A method that taps into the collective wisdom of users.\n","As we progress through this notebook, I'll furnish an overview of each technique, elucidate their inner workings, and guide you through their implementation using Python, alongside essential libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn.\n","\n","Let's embark on this journey of recommendation systems, combining theory with hands-on Python implementation!"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Additional -
